### Understanding Intelligence Unit Costs

Different actions use different amounts of Intelligence Units:

| Action                                     | Cost                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Asking a question to Basic model           | 1-3 IUs             |
| Asking Complex Problem-Solving model (Pro) | 15-20 IUs           |
| Web search integration                     | 2-5 IUs per search  |
| Video/Audio transcription                  | 1 IU per minute     |
| Image analysis                             | 1 IU per image      |
| Document search                            | 0.5-1 IU per search |

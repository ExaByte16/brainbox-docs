## Key Features

### Security & Compliance

BrainBox takes security seriously from the ground up. Your data is encrypted both in transit using HTTPS/TLS and at rest with AES-256 encryption. Access control is managed through role-based permissions with four distinct levels: Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer, giving you granular control over who can do what.

The platform follows industry security standards through trusted providers like AWS, Supabase, and Pinecone. Complete audit logs track all activity, ensuring you have the paper trail needed for compliance requirements.

### AI-Powered Intelligence

At the core of BrainBox is intelligent AI that understands your documents. Choose from six different AI models—Auto, Default, Precise, Pro, Flash, and Teacher—each optimized for different types of questions. Every answer the AI provides includes citations that link directly to source documents, so you can always verify the information.

The platform offers both semantic search (where AI understands the meaning of your query) and traditional full-text search for precise keyword matching. BrainBox supports over 50 file formats including PDFs, Word documents, images with OCR, spreadsheets, and even source code.

```
🤖 AI MODELS FOR DIFFERENT TASKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Auto     → Let AI choose the best model
Default  → Balanced for most questions
Precise  → When accuracy matters most
Pro      → Complex deep analysis
Flash    → Quick answers, speed focused
Teacher  → Learning & explanations
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Team Collaboration

Collaboration in BrainBox starts with workspaces. You can organize your teams and projects into separate workspaces, each with its own members and permissions. The role-based access system (Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer) ensures everyone has exactly the permissions they need.

Share specific document collections (Boxes) without giving access to your entire workspace, or create public shareable links for clients and stakeholders who need to see specific content.

### Enterprise Ready

For organizations that need more power, BrainBox provides API access for programmatic integrations and automation. The platform scales from small teams to full enterprise deployments with scalable storage that grows with your needs.

Usage tracking helps you monitor Intelligence Units, Indexed Pages, and Storage consumption in real-time. Business accounts get dedicated professional support to ensure your team stays productive.

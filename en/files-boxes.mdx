# Files & Boxes

Learn how to manage documents, create organized collections (Boxes), and use tags to keep everything accessible.

## Files: Storage & Management

### Supported File Types

BrainBox supports over 50 file formats, making it versatile for any kind of document work.

**Documents** are fully supported, including PDFs (even scanned ones with OCR), Word documents with complete text extraction, PowerPoint presentations with all slides included, Excel spreadsheets where formulas and data are preserved, and plain text files in various formats.

**Images** get the AI treatment too. JPEG, PNG, and TIFF files are analyzed and text is extracted via OCR, making all image types searchable with visual recognition.

**Audio & Video** files are automatically transcribed using speech-to-text, turning your audio and video content into searchable text. Supported formats include MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC, AAC, AC3, and OPUS.

**Data Files** like CSV get automatic data analysis, while JSON and XML files have their data structures preserved for easy querying.

**Code** files are supported too, with full syntax highlighting and searchability for JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and over 20 more programming languages.

<Tip>

**Best Practices**

Use clear, descriptive file names from the start—your future self will thank you. Organize files into relevant Boxes so related documents stay together. Add tags for quick categorization and filtering. Regularly delete old or unnecessary files to keep your workspace clean and stay within quota limits. And please, don't use unclear names like "Document1.pdf" that tell you nothing about the content!

## Boxes: Organized Collections

### What is a Box?

A **Box** is a collection of related files with a dedicated AI chat area. Think of it as a project folder containing all files for one project, a client collection holding everything for a specific client, a topic library organizing files about one subject, or a case dossier with all files related to one case. Boxes make it easy to keep related documents together and have focused conversations about them.

### Why Use Boxes?

  <Card title="Organization" icon="list-check">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Focused Chats" icon="message-dots">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy Sharing" icon="share-nodes">
    Share entire collections with one permission set
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Collaboration" icon="users">
    All team members see same organized structure
  </Card>

### Managing Boxes

**Viewing Your Boxes**

Click the "Boxes" section and all your boxes appear in a list or grid view. Each box shows its name, file count, creation date, and number of chat conversations.

**Sorting & Filtering**

Sort your boxes by name, recently updated, created date, or most used. Filter them to see just your boxes, boxes shared with you, or all boxes at once.

**Finding a Box**

Use the search box at the top, type the box name, and results filter instantly as you type.

**Opening a Box**

Click the box name to open it. You'll see all files in the box, the chat interface appears, and you can scroll to view previous conversations.

**Renaming a Box**

Click the box name or edit icon, enter the new name, and press Enter to save. Simple as that.

**Deleting a Box**

<Note>
Deleting a Box does NOT delete the files. Files remain in your Files section and can be added to other boxes.
</Note>

1. Find box in list
2. Click three-dot menu
3. Select "Delete Box"
4. Confirm deletion
5. Box is removed, files stay safe

### Managing Files Within Boxes

## Tags: Smart Organization

### What are Tags?

**Tags** are labels you create to organize and find files quickly. You might use status tags like "Important", "Review", "Final", or "Draft". Project tags like "Client_ABC", "Project_Q4", or "2025_Budget" help you filter by engagement. Security tags such as "Confidential", "Public", or "Internal" indicate access levels.

### Creating Tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Workspace Settings">
    Click workspace name → "Settings"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Tags Section">
    Look for "Tags" or "Labels"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Tag">
    Click "Create Tag" or "+"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Tag">
    Use clear, consistent names
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Color">
    Pick a color for visual identification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Tag is now available to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Applying Tags

**To Single Files**
1. Click file details
2. Find "Tags" section
3. Click "Add Tag"
4. Select tag from list
5. Tag appears on file

**To Multiple Files**
1. Select multiple files (checkboxes)
2. Click "Add Tags" button
3. Select one or more tags
4. Tags applied to all selected files

### Using Tags to Filter

1. In file list, see tag filter options
2. Click tag to filter
3. Only files with that tag appear
4. Select multiple tags to combine filters
5. Can use AND or OR logic

### Managing Tags

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Edit** | Click tag → Edit name/color/description |
| **Delete** | Click tag → Delete (removes tag from all files) |

<Note>
Tags can be edited or deleted. Once a tag is deleted, it's removed from all files that had it.
</Note>

### Best Practices for Tags

**Use Consistent Naming** by sticking to a pattern. "Client_ABC" and "Client_XYZ" work great together. Mixing "Client ABC", "ClientABC", and "ABC" creates confusion and defeats the purpose.

**Choose Meaningful Colors** that make sense at a glance. Red signals urgent or important items, green indicates approved or final versions, yellow marks things pending review, and blue can denote internal or reference materials.

**Keep Tag Counts Reasonable** with around 10-20 tags across your workspace. Having 100+ tags becomes too hard to manage and you'll spend more time choosing tags than actually working.

**Combine with Boxes** strategically. Use boxes for major organization (like separating clients or projects) and tags for detailed categorization within those boxes (like status, priority, or document type).

## File Organization Strategy

### Recommended Structure

```
Workspace: "Company Name"
├── Box: "Client Projects"
│   ├── Files tagged: "Client_A", "Q4", "Active"
│   ├── Files tagged: "Client_B", "Q3", "Archived"
│
├── Box: "Internal Operations"
│   ├── Files tagged: "Finance", "Budget", "2025"
│   ├── Files tagged: "HR", "Policies", "Current"
│
├── Box: "Research & Reference"
│   ├── Files tagged: "Industry_Analysis", "Research"
│   ├── Files tagged: "Competitor_Research", "2024"
```

### Planning Your Organization

Before uploading files, take a moment to plan your organization. Ask yourself: How many Boxes do you need? Usually 3-5 main ones is plenty. What files go in each? Organize by project, client, document type, or team. What tags will help? Consider status, urgency, confidentiality, and date tags. Who needs access? Remember that individual boxes can have different permissions.

### Tips

Create Boxes before uploading lots of files—it's easier to organize as you go than to sort through hundreds of files later. Tag files as you upload them while the context is fresh. Use consistent naming conventions so everyone on your team understands the system. Archive old boxes instead of deleting them so you maintain history. Review your organization quarterly to make sure it still makes sense as your work evolves.

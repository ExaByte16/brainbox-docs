## Understanding Quotas

### Intelligence Units (IU)

**What Are They?**

Intelligence Units (IUs) are credits you use when interacting with AI. Every question, search, or analysis costs IUs depending on the complexity and which AI model you're using.

**How Much Does Each Action Cost?**

The Default and Flash models are the most economical at just 1-3 IUs per question. The Precise model costs the same but prioritizes accuracy. The Pro model is significantly more expensive at 15-20 IUs per question, but it's designed for complex analysis. Web searches cost 2-5 IUs, image analysis is 1 IU per image, and audio transcription runs 1 IU per minute.

**Monthly Reset**

Your IU quota resets on your renewal date each month. If you run out before then, you won't be able to make new chats until the next month rolls around—unless you upgrade to a plan with more units.

**Tips to Conserve**

Use Default or Flash for routine questions and save the Pro model for genuinely complex problems. Ask specific, well-formed questions to avoid multiple follow-ups. When you just need to find something rather than analyze it, use search instead of chat.

### Indexed Pages

**What Is It?**

Indexed Pages tracks the total count of document pages you've uploaded and processed. This is a monthly quota that measures how much content BrainBox has analyzed for you.

**How Is It Counted?**

For PDFs, each page counts as one. Word documents use their actual page count. Spreadsheets count each sheet as a page. Images each count as one page.

**Does It Reset?**

Yes, your Indexed Pages quota resets monthly on your renewal date, giving you a fresh allocation.

**When You Hit Limit**

Once you've hit your limit, you cannot upload more files. You'll need to either delete existing files to make room or upgrade to a plan with a higher page limit.

### Storage Space

**What Is It?**

Storage Space is the total file size you can store, combining all your files together. This measures the actual disk space your files occupy.

**How Is It Calculated?**

It's based on actual file size in MB or GB. PDFs, images, documents—everything counts toward your total storage.

**Does It Reset?**

No, storage is persistent across months. It doesn't reset like Intelligence Units or Indexed Pages do.

**When Full**

When your storage is full, the upload button becomes disabled and you'll see an error message: "Storage limit reached". You'll need to delete files or upgrade your plan to continue.

### Video/Audio Minutes

<Note>
Video and audio transcription features are available and work as described in [Files & Boxes](/en/files-boxes). However, quota tracking for these features is deprecated. You can upload and transcribe video/audio files without being limited by a specific minutes quota.
</Note>

## Checking Your Usage

### View Current Quota

1. Click **workspace name** (top-left)
2. Go to **"Plan"** or **"Billing"**
3. Find **"Quota"** or **"Usage"** section
4. You see:
   - Intelligence Units: X/Y used this month
   - Indexed Pages: X/Y (monthly limit)
   - Storage: X MB of Y MB used

<Note>
Usage display does not show color-coded status indicators. Check your current usage and plan limits directly.
</Note>

### Monitoring Usage

For optimal usage management, consider checking daily (though it's optional) to get a sense of your IU consumption rate and plan heavy usage for the beginning of the month when you have a full quota.

Weekly checks are recommended to verify you're staying on track, identify if you're using more than expected, and adjust your behavior if needed.

Before each monthly renewal, review whether your plan still fits your needs. If you're frequently maxed out, consider upgrading. If you're barely using your quota, you might want to downgrade and save money.

## Upgrading Your Plan

### Method 1: From Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click profile icon → "Settings"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Subscription">
    Look for "Subscription" or "Plans"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Upgrade">
    Find "Upgrade Plan" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select New Plan">
    Choose higher-tier plan
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Pay">
    Review pricing and complete payment
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: When You Hit a Limit

When maxed out, you'll see notification:
1. Click **"Upgrade Plan"**
2. Follow upgrade process above
3. New limits immediately available

### Upgrade Details

When you upgrade, your quotas reset immediately to your new plan's limits. Your used pages and Intelligence Units go back to 0, and you get the full capacity of your new plan. That's it—instant access to your upgraded quotas.

**Example:** You're on Starter with 300 IU and 1,000 indexed pages. You've used 200 IU and 800 pages. When you upgrade to Plus, your IU and pages reset to 0, and you now have 600 IU and 2,000 pages available to use.

## Downgrading Your Plan

### Downgrade Timeline

<Warning>
Downgrades take effect immediately. Your new quotas apply right away.
</Warning>

1. Go to **Plan Settings**
2. Click **"Downgrade"** or **"Change Plan"**
3. Select lower plan
4. Confirm downgrade
5. Takes effect immediately

### Things to Know About Downgrading

Your data stays safe when you downgrade. Files are not deleted, boxes and chats remain intact—you just have lower quotas going forward.

If you exceed the new plan's quotas, you'll experience restrictions. For example, if you downgrade from Plus (2,000 pages) to Starter (1,000 pages) while currently using 1,500 pages, you won't be able to upload new files on your next billing cycle until you're under 1,000 pages. You'll need to delete files to come into compliance.

**Recommendation:** Delete unnecessary files before downgrading, ensure you're under the new quota limits, and avoid any service interruption.

## Billing Information

### Payment Methods

BrainBox accepts major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. All payments are processed securely via PayU and Trelli—your payment information is never stored on BrainBox servers.

### Billing Cycles

**Monthly Plans** bill on the same date each month and auto-renew by default. You can cancel anytime, and you'll retain access until the end of your current billing period.

**Yearly Plans** offer a discounted rate compared to monthly billing—you can save 20-30%. You're billed once per year, which also means less frequent billing administration.

### Invoices

Invoices are sent automatically to your email after each billing event. They show your plan name, billing duration, amount charged, and date. Keep these for your tax and accounting records.

### Canceling Your Subscription

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Subscription">
    Click profile → Settings → Subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Cancel">
    Find "Cancel Subscription" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    You'll keep access until end of billing period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    After period ends, reverts to FREE plan
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Important:**
- Your data is NOT deleted when you cancel
- Files stay safe until you delete them
- Can re-subscribe anytime
- Free plan still available

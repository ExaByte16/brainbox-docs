## Step 2: First Login & Dashboard

### Log In

1. Go to [brainbox.com.co](https://brainbox.com.co)
2. Click **"Log In"**
3. Choose:
   - **Google** - Click "Continue with Google"
   - **Microsoft** - Click "Continue with Microsoft"
4. Authenticate with your provider

You're now in your **Personal Workspace** (labeled "Me"), which is your private space.

### Understanding Your Dashboard

Your dashboard has a left sidebar organized into two main sections.

Under **PERSONAL**, you'll find **My Boxes** which shows your organized file collections—these are like folders where you group related documents and can chat with AI about them. **My Files** contains all your uploaded documents in one place, regardless of which box they're in. **My API Keys** lets you manage API access for integrations and automations.

Under **ACCOUNT**, you'll find **My Plan** where you can view your subscription details, check your usage quotas (Intelligence Units, Storage, Indexed Pages), and manage billing.

<Note>
To check your usage (Intelligence Units, Storage, Indexed Pages), click on **My Plan** in the left sidebar under the ACCOUNT section.
</Note>

## Step 3: Upload Your First Document

### Prepare Your File

Before uploading, make sure your file meets these requirements: it should be in one of the [supported formats](/en/files-boxes#supported-file-types) like PDF, Word, images, or spreadsheets. The file needs to be under 1 GB in size, and it can't be corrupted or password-protected (BrainBox needs to be able to read the content to index it).

### Upload

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Upload">
    In the **My Files** section, click **"Upload Files"** or **"+ Add Files"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select File">
    Choose the file from your computer and click **"Open"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    The file uploads and BrainBox analyzes it (usually 1-5 minutes depending on size, max 8 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    Status changes to **"Indexed"** - it's now searchable and ready to use
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can drag and drop files directly into BrainBox to upload them faster.
</Note>

## Step 4: Create Your First Box

A **Box** is a collection of related files with AI chat capability. Perfect for organizing by project, client, or topic.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Boxes">
    Click **"My Boxes"** in the left sidebar under PERSONAL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Box">
    Click **"Create Box"** or **"+ New Box"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Box">
    Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Q4 Marketing Plan", "Client ABC Contracts")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Files">
    Select the documents to include, or add them later
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **"Create Box"** - you're done!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Ask Your First Question

Now comes the magic - ask BrainBox a question about your documents.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Box">
    Click on the Box you just created
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Chat">
    Look for the chat input area at the bottom
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type a Question">
    Ask naturally, like: "What are the main topics in these files?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an Answer">
    BrainBox analyzes your documents and provides an answer with source citations
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with specific questions for best results. Instead of "Tell me about this file," try "What is the budget for Q4?"
</Tip>

## Pro Tips

**Organize Early** by using descriptive file names and Box names from the start. Instead of "Document1.pdf", try "Q4_Marketing_Plan_2024.pdf". Your future self will thank you when searching for that specific file.

**Use Tags** to add another layer of organization. Tags let you quickly filter files by status (Draft, Final), project, client, or any other category that makes sense for your workflow.

**Experiment with Questions** to find what works best. The AI is flexible—if one phrasing doesn't give you the answer you want, try asking the same question in a different way. You'll quickly learn what gets the best results.

**Monitor Your Usage** to avoid surprises. Keep track of your Intelligence Units in your plan settings, especially if you're using the Pro model frequently. This helps you plan your usage and upgrade before you hit limits.
